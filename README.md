# Zero-shot-Classification-Example

What is Zero-shot Classification?
Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where instead of giving training examples, a high-level description of new categories is given so that the machine can relate it to existing categories that the machine has learned about2. The purpose of generative Zero-shot learning is to learn from seen classes, 
transfer the learned knowledge, and create samples of unseen classes from the description of these unseen categories1. With zero-shot learning, we can create a mapping connecting low-level features and a semantic description of auxiliary data to classify unknown classes of actions3.
